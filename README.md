\textbf{journalApp} integrates data from all your apps and devices to build a detailed, intelligent journal of your daily life. It features two main views — a structured list (with sub-items like tasks) and a timeline. It can process videos and photos from AI glasses, stationary, or wearable cameras, storing or summarizing them to create rich daily summaries.
Designed as a core module of a larger AI assistant, but also functions independently.
